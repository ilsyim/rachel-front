# Rachel Bui's Photography Portfolio
My friend asked if I would be able to create a website where she could showcase the concert photos she's taken over the years. I'm still working on fixing the date/time display, mobile view, and possibly changing the name of this app and the color scheme. But this app only exists because my friend asked me to build it, so we'll see ðŸ˜„
